This project is a static clone of the Salesforce User Interface, designed exclusively for desktop screens. It is built using HTML5 and CSS3 with a fixed-width layout and no use of JavaScript. The primary focus is on replicating the design and structure of Salesforce's UI without dynamic functionality.
